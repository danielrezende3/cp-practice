# Competitive Programming Practice Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various competitive programming contests, primarily Codeforces rounds across Div. 4, Div. 3, and beyond. It also includes helpers for scaffolding new contests and VS Code integration.

## Repository Structure

Each contest is organized in its own folder, named after the contest and division. For example:

```
./contests
├── Codeforces Round 1003 (Div. 4)/
│   ├── a.cpp      # Problem A solution
│   ├── a.input    # Sample input for testing
│   ├── b.cpp
│   ├── b.input
│   ├── c1.cpp
│   ├── c1.input
│       ...
├── Codeforces Round 1013 (Div. 3)/
│   ├── a.cpp
│   ├── a.input
│   ├── b.cpp
│   ├── b.input
│       ...
```

Each `.cpp` file implements `solve()` and `main()` to handle one test case (or multiple, as described in the problem). Sample inputs (`*.input`) are provided for quick local testing.

## Creating new contest folders

You can automatically create a new contest folder with boilerplate files using [new_contest.sh](scripts/new_contest.sh):

```bash
# Usage: scripts/new_contest.sh "<contest-folder-name>" <num-of-problems|last-problem-letter>
./scripts/new_contest.sh "Codeforces Round 1025 (Div. 3)" 13
# or
./scripts/new_contest.sh "Codeforces Round 1025 (Div. 3)" a
# or 
./scripts/new_contest.sh "Codeforces Round 1025 (Div. 3)" Z
```

## Contest Reporting

Use [contest_report.py](scripts/contest_report.py) to generate CSV reports from completed contests:

```bash
# Generate report for a specific contest
python3 scripts/contest_report.py "contests/Codeforces Round 1025 (Div. 3)" -o results.csv
```

The script extracts information from the first two comment lines of each `.cpp` file:
- `// time-taken: <minutes>` - Time spent solving the problem
- `// tag: <status>` - Problem status (SOLVED, TIMEOUT, PARTIAL, NO_IDEA)

Valid tags: `SOLVED`, `TIMEOUT`, `PARTIAL`, `NO_IDEA`

The generated CSV includes:
- Contest name
- Problem file
- Time taken
- Tag/status
- Overall status (SOLVED_ON_TIME if ≤20 minutes, TIME_EXCEEDED if >20 minutes)

## How to Build & Run

The root [Makefile](Makefile) is intended for quick local testing of contest files in
the current directory. It compiles with `clang++`, C++20, optimization enabled, and
`-DLOCAL`.

- **Run a problem sample:**
  ```bash
  make a
  ```
  This compiles `a.cpp` to `.build/a`, runs it with `a.in`, and writes the result to
  `a.out`.

- **Run additional samples for the same problem:**
  ```bash
  make a1
  make a2
  ```
  These reuse `.build/a`, read from `a1.in` or `a2.in`, and write to `a1.out` or
  `a2.out`.

- **Supported problem targets:**
  ```bash
  make a
  make b
  make c
  make d
  make e
  make f
  ```
  Numbered sample targets are also supported for each problem letter, such as
  `make b1`, `make c2`, or `make f3`.

- **Clean generated files:**
  ```bash
  make clean
  ```
  This removes `.build/` and any `*.out` files in the current directory.

- **Compile a solution manually:**
  ```bash
  g++-13 -std=c++17 path/to/solution.cpp -O2 -o solution.out
  ./solution.out < path/to/input_file
  ```

- **VS Code Task:** Use the built-in task **C/C++: g++-13 arquivo de build ativo** to compile the current file. It will produce an executable with `.out` suffix in the same directory.
- **VS Code Debug**: Launch via **(gdb) Iniciar** in the debug panel (configured in .vscode/launch.json). It will run the `.out` binary with `< ${fileBasenameNoExtension}.input`.
